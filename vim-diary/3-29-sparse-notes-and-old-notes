============================================================
				Vim old notes and sparse (unstructed) notes
============================================================

----
3-29 - move garbage out of rc file
---

" this file is written in vimscript - reminder to myself
" reminder that noremap is nonrecursive

" 3/4/24 - treat this like a 'vim diary' of things learned + update log
" - fzf is not integrated with nerdtree. doing C in nerdtree doesn't change the working directory of the vim instance
"- so, always call vim from ~ and then use Files to find the project (unless you find an exception), and change working directory using C

" 3/9/24 - add autoformat using formatprog
"	and also working on autocomplete
" autocomplete not added yet 
" but added vim session, vim-startify, failed to add cool cow, and also found that vim-prosession doesn't work with startify
" also got clang-format working for cpp file

" 3/17/24 - i ought to map Files and Buffers into shortcuts..
" fixed trampling tmux prefix 
" map certain common things - write, quit, save session, into leader key
" added dependency - install ripgrep

" 3/20 last time I didn't figure out how to use nerdtree properly - the plugin that saves the nerdtree
" state doesn't seem to work.
" so, i figure it's time to ask, why not use netrw? it supposedly works with sftp, scp, etc
" but first, I want to learn ctrl-w (resizing panes) - I think a couple quick shortcuts should do the trick because I mainly use even splits
" both are going in the backlog
" added mouse resizing for panes

" changed line 4 like this in file: vimplugins/nerdtree-project-plugin/nerdtree_plugin/project.vim
"command! -nargs=0 -complete=customlist,NERDTreeCompleteProjectNames NERDTreeProjectLoadFromCWD call g:NERDTreeProject.LoadFromCWD()
"edit took suggestion from reddit guy
"uncomment
" command! -nargs=0 NERDTreeProjectLoadFromCWD call g:NERDTreeProject.LoadFromCWD()

" tried that, nerdtree error is gone but it still doesn't work...
" added yank directory of current buffer into clipboard

" i think the best option here is fern... 

"
"	My backlog of stuff to take care of / learn:
"   ====================================
"
"	Visual block - commenting out multiple lines
"	properly learn find and replace
"	autocomplete and lsp integration
" 	session management (save session, restore)
"	resizing panes (ctrlw)
"	netrw - a big one I think - nvm internet says it sucks
" can we please map nohl ot sometihng bro
" another problem - leader should be remapped - , is already 'go back in line search' and I think
" 	that's why 'recording ...' pops up
" 

" 3/28 - change approach to learning fundamentals and building from them rather htan
" adding feature sthta I don't use
